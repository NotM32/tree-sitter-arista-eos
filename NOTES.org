#+title: Notes on EOS syntax styles

* Configuration Sections
The easiest way to implement recognition of a sectional command
is to read whitespace, and assume either a '!' token encountered
or a de-indent as the section end

However the arguably more correct way also brings about some issues
with the variety found between vendor implementations. NX-OS for instance,
has a much more hierarchial BGP configuration than EOS, FRR and IOS. As
a result, there will be differences in the commands and the need to implement
dialects may emerge.

For now, we will take a split path approach and support whitespaced section
recognition as a choice alongside token specific sections for majorly similar
commands, like route-map declarations and the router instance lead in.
