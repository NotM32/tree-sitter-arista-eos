# tree-sitter-arista-eos
 Grammars for FRR, Arista EOS, Cisco iOS/NXOS style network configuration files.
 
 With the intent of providing some syntax highlighting, validation and maybe other
 features for those who don't strictly work in a router shell all day. Though
 if you SSH from your editor, tree-sitter sytnax highlighting should work there
 also.
 
 A work in progress. If interest is shown, I may go deeper.
